# Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash. The array will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, will produce a person's name. The hash will contain two keys, :title and :occupation, and the appropriate values. Your method should return a greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title and occupation.
