# a method that returns the sum of two integers

# START
# DEFINE method called sum_of_integers 
# - must take TWO parameters both of which will be integers (num1 & num2)
# within the method perform an operation that adds num1 to num 2 into a variable called result
# END the decleration of the method

# invoke the method with two numerical parameters
# PRINT the outcome to the console using puts

# END

# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# START
# DEFINE a method called string_concatenation 
# - must take an array as a parameter
# the method must convert the array into a concatenated string, most likely using the .join method
# END the method definition
# DEFINE a variable that is an array containing a series of seperated strings
# CALL the method, passing through the newly created array as the only parameter and store the result in a variable named concatenated_string
# PRINT concatenated_string to the console to check your result
# END

# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. 

# START
# DEFINE an array that contains a series of integers
# DEFINE an empty array to be used later
# DEFINE a method that accepts one parameter that will be an array
# within the method, invoke the each slice method, which will iterate over the parameter input and return the result into the previously declared array
# END the method decleration
# INVOKE the method passing through the original array as the only parameter. 
# PRINT the new array to ensure it has worked as expected
# END
